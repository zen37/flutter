This is my submission for the contest https://flutter.dev/clock

Analog clock it is as I did not want to create another digital thing. Also, no plastic or stainless steel look, just something that resembles the nature, a "woody" background.

And no second hand, no need for a continuous reminder of the inexorable passing of time.
